# MyShell
Developed a basic shell which launch in a separate window. 

Requirements:

-> The shell should launch in a separate window.

-> The shell should also be able to handle CTRL-C elegantly i.e. it should not result in killing the shell.

-> Functionalities expected: cd, history, clear, piping, redirecting stdin and stdout (using > and <), kill, handling Cntrl+C, handling erroneous commands, handling return (enter), help which will list all the built-in commands implemented by the shell.

-> No use of 'system' command - you have to write your own shell and not use existing shell.

Instructions to execute the Makefile:
'make --file=2015033_Shell_1.makefile'
